Lora sensor node sends data to Lora gateway which in turn sends to TTN cloud via Raspberry pi gateway. Here the Lora sensor node measures the accelerometer,temp, humidity, pressure, altitude data.  

Here lora gateway acts as a network bridge between lora and ethernet communication.Lora is prefered for low data rate and large distance coverage.
